Easily add MLA style citations to your WordPress posts.

== Description ==
This plugin adds five shortcodes to your WordPress site. The first one generates a "Works Cited" section, three generate appropriately formatted citations for books, periodicals, and journals, and the last allows you to add notes to your citations.

This plugin also adds a shortcode (hly) for highlighting text in quotations, as well as shortcodes for clearing floats.

== How to Add MLA Citations ==
* Begin with the shortcode `[mlaworks]` and end with the shortcode `[/mlaworks]`. This creates your "Works Cited" section and adds the title "Works Cited" at the top. 
* Use the shortcode `[mlabook]` to cite a book. 
* Use the shortcode `[mlamagazine]` to cite an article in a non-scholarly magazine (such as *National Geographic*). 
* Use the shortcode `[mlajournal]` to cite an article in a scholarly journal.
* `[mlabook]`, `[mlamagazine]`, and `[mlajournal]` all use variables to properly format citation information. To see how to use these variables, please visit http://www.kjodle.net/wordpress/mla-citations/.
* Use the shortcode `[note]` immediately after `[mlabook]`, `[mlamagazine]`, or `[mlajournal]` to add a note (as a separate paragraph) to a citation.
* Use the shortcode `[hly]` and `[/hly]` to add yellow highlighting to a portion of text.
