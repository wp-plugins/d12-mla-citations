Easily add MLA style citations to your WordPress posts.

== Description ==

**Academic publishing just got easier.** This plugin makes it easy for you to add an MLA-style "Works Cited" section to your WordPress posts and pages. It creates citations consistent with the 7th edition of the *MLA Handbook for Writers of Research Papers*. For more information, please visit the [Purdue OWL](https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/section/2/11/).

This plugin also has a shortcode (hly) for highlighting text in quotations, as well as shortcodes for clearing floats (clear, clearleft, clearright).

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Will this plugin handle multiple authors? =

Yes, just enter it as you want it to appear: `Updike, John, and Henry David Thoreau`

= Do I need to add quotation marks around article titles? =

No, the plugin will handle it for you.

= Do I need to italicize book titles, journal titles, or magazine titles? =

No, the plugin will automatically italicize the titles of books, magazines, and academic journals.

= What's the difference between adding "Additional information" at the end of a citation and adding a note to a citation? =

The "Additional information" will be appended to the end of the citation paragraph. A note gets added below it, in a separate paragraph. See the screenshots for an example.

= What's the difference between "end punctuation" and "internal punctuation"? =

"End punctuation" is what comes at the end of each part of the citation. For example, a period after the author(s), another period after the title, etc.

"Internal punctuation" refers to punctuation within each part of the citation, for example, the comma in the author's name: "Lastname, Firstname".

= The highlighting and clear floats plugins do not show up in the drop-down menu. =

No, but they will be added in a future update. They can still be accessed by adding the appropriate shortcode manually.

= I made a mistake in one of my citations. Do I need to delete it and start over again? =

No. All your data is entered into your post as a shortcode, so you can edit your data in the shortcode.
